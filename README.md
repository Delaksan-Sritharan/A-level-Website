# Educational Website - README

## Overview

This repository contains the front-end code for a simple educational website designed to provide access to learning materials for various subjects: Mathematics, Biology, Physics, and Chemistry. The website features a navigation bar for easy access to different subject pages and a consistent footer with a copyright notice.

The home page offers an introduction and an overview of the available subjects, along with some highlighted features of the platform. The Physics page provides a searchable and filterable list of downloadable files organized by year.

## File Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
├── css/
│   ├── global.css    # Global styles for the website
│   └── home.css      # Specific styles for the home page
├── js/
│   └── universal.js  # Potentially contains JavaScript for the website
├── images/           # (Placeholder for images used on the site)
│   ├── ...
├── Home.html         # The main landing page
├── biology.html      # (Placeholder for the Biology subject page)
├── chemistry.html    # (Placeholder for the Chemistry subject page)
├── mathamatics.html  # (Placeholder for the Mathematics subject page)
├── physics.html      # The Physics subject page with downloadable files
└── README.md         # This file, providing information about the project
## Technologies Used

* HTML5: For structuring the web pages.
* CSS3: For styling the layout and appearance of the website.
* JavaScript: (Potentially for interactive elements, located in `js/universal.js`).
* Font Awesome: (Used for icons on the home page, linked via CDN).

## Getting Started

To view this website locally:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project in your file explorer.
3.  Open the `Home.html` file in your web browser.

The other subject pages (`biology.html`, `chemistry.html`, `mathamatics.html`, `physics.html`) can be accessed through the navigation bar on the home page.

## Key Features

* **Navigation Bar:** Provides easy access to the main subject pages.
* **Home Page:**
    * Welcoming hero section with a call to action.
    * Overview of the available subjects with links to their respective pages.
    * Highlights key features of the learning platform.
* **Physics Page:**
    * Search functionality to find files by year.
    * Filtering options to view all years or special years.
    * A table listing downloadable physics-related files organized by year with download buttons.
* **Consistent Footer:** Displays a copyright notice on all pages.

## CSS Styling

* `css/global.css`: Contains styles that are applied across the entire website, such as basic body styles, table styling for the Physics page, and the navigation bar.
* `css/home.css`: Includes styles specific to the layout and elements of the home page, such as the hero section, subject overview, and features section.

## JavaScript

The `js/universal.js` file is included in the HTML but its specific functionality is not detailed here. It may contain scripts for interactive elements or other dynamic behavior on the website.

## Images

The `images/` directory is a placeholder for any images used on the website (e.g., icons for subjects on the home page). Currently, the home page uses Font Awesome icons, so this directory might not contain any files initially.

## Potential Improvements

* Implement the content and layout for the `biology.html`, `chemistry.html`, and `mathamatics.html` pages.
* Add more interactive elements and dynamic functionality using JavaScript.
* Enhance the styling and responsiveness of the website for different screen sizes.
* Implement a backend to manage and serve the downloadable files more efficiently.
* Add more advanced search and filtering options on the Physics page.
